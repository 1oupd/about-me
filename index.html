            <h4> Why they wanted to start CodeNation: </h4>
            <p class="p2">After learning to edit HTML/CSS blog templates as a teenager (when all I knew about my forthcoming career, was that I wanted to work with computers) re-visiting the languages again in my early twenties, has led me to realise that this is the career path I want to follow. Code Nation was reccommended to me by my partner of a recent cohort, as well as by their cohort-colleagues. Whilst taking the Develop course, I was surprised at just how passionate I felt   about building with code, and I'm excited to continue! </p> 
            <h4>They're currently learning:</h4>
            <p class="p2"> javascript, git </p>
            <h3> Their week 1 targets are:</h3>
            <p class="p2"> To gain more vocal confidence, and to build a stronger knowledge of javascript and flexbox</p>
            <h3>To achieve this, they will:</h3>
            <p class="p2"> Do a lot of Googling, and practising all three</p>
